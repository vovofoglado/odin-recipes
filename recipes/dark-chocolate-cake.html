        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol type="1" class="lista">
            <li>Preheat air fryer to 320 degrees F (160 degrees C). Coat a 6-inch cake pan with cooking spray. 
            Line bottom of pan with parchment paper; dust with 2 tablespoons flour, tapping out excess.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Stir together 1/4 cup flour, the cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a small bowl.
            In another small bowl, whisk together buttermilk, applesauce, oil, espresso powder, and vanilla.</li>
            <br>
            <li>In a third bowl, beat egg with an electric mixer at low speed. Gradually add sugar. Increase mixer
            speed to high and continue beating until mixture is thick and pale, about 2 minutes.            </li>
            <br>
            <li>Alternately fold flour mixture and buttermilk mixture into egg mixture with a rubber spatula, 
            stirring until incorporated before adding next addition. Fold in dark chocolate.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Pour batter into the prepared pan. Arrange pan in the air fryer basket.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Cook until a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Let cool in pan on
            a wire rack about 10 minutes. Remove cake from pan and allow to cool completely on a wire rack.</li>
            <br>
            <li>For the frosting, melt butter in a heavy saucepan over medium heat; cook, stirring occasionally,
            until butter begins to turn golden brown and smells nutty, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer butter to a bowl; cool for 10 minutes.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Whisk in honey and vanilla. Whisk in powdered sugar until smooth, adding water, 1 teaspoon at a time,
            until desired consistency. The frosting will look separated but will come together with whisking in water
            a little at a time.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Immediately top cooled cake with the frosting and garnish with additional dark chocolate.</li>
        </ol>
