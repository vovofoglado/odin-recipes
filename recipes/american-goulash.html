        <h4>
            <p>
            "American goulash was one of my all-time favorite comfort food meals when I was growing up.
            They served it in my school cafeteria alongside a slice of buttered white bread and a carton of milk.
            This Americanized version of goulash was invented to stretch a small amount of beef into enough food for
            a not-so-small family. It's a simple dish that doesn't taste simple, so it's perfect for your weeknight
            dinner rotation."</h4>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol type="I">
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Heat oil in a pot over medium-high heat. Add ground beef and onion; cook and stir until beef is browned
            and crumbly and onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Continue to cook and stir until liquid is evaporated,
            3 to 5 minutes. Add garlic, bay leaves, paprika, Italian seasoning, salt, black pepper, and cayenne.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Cook, stirring occasionally, until flavors come together, about 3 minutes. Pour in broth, marinara sauce,
            and diced tomatoes. Pour water into the sauce jar, swirl, and pour into the pot. Stir in soy sauce; bring to
            a simmer. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer until flavors intensify, about 30 minutes.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Increase the heat to medium-high and bring to a rapid simmer. Stir in macaroni; cook, stirring occasionally,
            until just barely tender, about 12 minutes. Check for doneness after 10 minutes.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Remove from the heat and discard bay leaves. Stir in Cheddar and parsley. Cover and let rest for 5 minutes.
            Taste and season as desired.</li>
